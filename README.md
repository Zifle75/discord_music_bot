# Discord Music Bot (Personal Project)

This repository contains a **personal Discord music bot** I built for my own use as a learning exercise and utility project.

The bot was created to explore Discord bot development and media playback without relying on paid third-party services.

---

## Project Context

- Built for **personal use and experimentation**
- Focused on functionality rather than production hardening
- Designed to solve a specific personal need

While the bot is functional, this project **should not be considered a production-ready or enterprise-quality implementation**. It reflects a casual, exploratory approach rather than professional software standards.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Working with Discord APIs and bot frameworks
- Handling user commands and event-driven interactions
- Managing audio playback and media streaming logic
- Debugging and iterating on a real, user-facing tool

---

## Limitations and Scope

This project intentionally omits or simplifies several aspects that would be required for professional deployment, including:

- Robust error handling and edge-case coverage
- Security hardening and permission management
- Scalability and performance optimizations
- Automated testing and long-term maintainability

---

## How I’d Approach This Today

If rebuilding this project now, I would:
- Improve overall architecture and modularity
- Add structured logging, testing, and configuration management
- Apply stricter security and permissions handling
- Design for extensibility and long-term maintenance

---

## Status

- Purpose: Personal / Hobby project
- Maintenance: Not actively maintained
- Intended Use: Educational and personal reference
